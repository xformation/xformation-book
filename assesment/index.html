        <p class="lead text-justify">
            We will conduct a 360-degree assessment of the current
            product, processes, within the company. This assessment
            will include a detailed audit of scalability, HA, management,
            security, performance, data protection aspects of
            the product. We will develop a IT transformation roadmap
            that can be used for advancement of Microservices adoption
            and the benefits that can be achieved. We will
            conduct POC’s to validate the proposed Microservices and
            Software Defined Transformation.
            <br>
            The assessment will include a detailed review and plan
